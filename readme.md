# Visual experiments

Some visual experiments built on my spare time. Probably deja vu but we got to start somewhere.

They are available on their page: http://bobylito.me/visualExperiments .

You can also enjoy them locally:

 - clone the repo
 - go into the repo folder: cd visualExperiments
 - install the dependencies: npm install
 - start the server: npm start
 - go to: http://localhost:8080

They do not require any backend so any http server would do the trick.
